After doing a change, make sure that Automat builds correctly. You can do that by running:

    python run.py "link automat"

If the task requires you to actually execute Automat, remember that it's a GUI app and you may have problems interacting with it. Therefore clearly state what you want user to do in the GUI app. You can start Automat by running:

    python run.py automat
