# Automat

[![Build](https://github.com/mafik/automat/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mafik/automat/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

Automat's objective is to be able to semi-autonomously play a variety of games. It's the first step towards a more general environment for interacting with
computers.

# Status

Currently Automat's functionality is limited to keyboard macro recording &
playback. It's fairly unstable but if you're lucky and it runs on your machine,
it can be useful for automating some basic actions.

You can, of course, check it out just to see how the interface works - but
don't assume that it's going to stay like that. It's very much a work in
progress. Roadmap includes some pretty radical new features which will
drastically change how it looks and works.

Current roadmap can be found [here](https://www.tldraw.com/ro/3d97dFMiuM0MLgqyyP0SG?d=v-1312.-804.2500.1170.page).

# Downloading and Running

Automat can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/mafik/automat/releases/latest/).

[Release Process.md](docs/design/Release%20Process.md) contains some more notes about the Automat's release regime.

# Contributing

First read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to get a general idea of how
things are organized. Once you do that, you may try to clone the Automat
repository and run it (build script should take care of everything for you - if
not - you can report it as a bug).

The same commands should work on Linux and Windows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mafik/automat.git
cd automat
./run.py automat
```
