# Object deletion in Automat

A designated corner is going to be used as a drag target for deleting objects (Vlojure approach)
Optionally also drag a trash icon onto the menu object to delete it
Alternatively a dock object with edit mode or buttons to move & delete objects
Alternatively drop objects outside of the canvas to delete them :P

- excluding the solution with context menu
- excluding the solution with "delete" button on every object

1. Pinning objects to the screen (they don't move with the camera)
2. Trash object that deletes all objects that are dragged over it
3. Trash grabber that can be grabbed to delete objects

4. A new "dock" object that holds the prototypes
  - buttons to delete and move prototypes around
  - "edit" mode when the dock can be altered (iOS approach)
