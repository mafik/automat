  Enforces staged execution discipline on large tasks: a written stage plan,

# Fable Mode

This skill encodes execution discipline for complex work: decompose before acting,
delegate where the runtime allows, verify with checks that can fail, self-critique
before delivery.

A note on what this is. The skill shapes the *procedure* a model follows. It does not
change the model's underlying capability. Coherence across long tasks and genuine
self-correction live in the weights, not in a prompt. On a model that already does
these well, the skill reinforces good habits. On a weaker model, it imposes structure
the model would otherwise skip, but it cannot lift the model's reasoning ceiling. Treat
this as a checklist, not a capability transplant.

## When NOT to use this

If a task has one obvious correct approach and fits in a single pass, do it directly and
skip this loop. Staging a trivial task wastes effort and buries the answer under
ceremony. This loop earns its cost only when a one-shot attempt would plausibly miss
something.

## Core Loop

The loop is constant across domains. Only the verification artifact in step 3 changes by
domain (see Domain-specific patterns).

**1. Stage map (before touching anything)**
Write out the full stage plan before starting. Number the stages. Include a brief
expected output for each. This is how you avoid discovering at stage 7 that you made a
wrong assumption at stage 2. Update the map when what you learn invalidates what you
planned. The map is a living document, not a contract.

Each stage should produce one verifiable artifact. If a stage produces nothing checkable,
merge it with the next.

Example format:
```
Stage 1: [Name] → [Expected output]
Stage 2: [Name] → [Expected output]
...
```

**2. Delegate independent work (if the runtime supports it)**
First check whether subagent/Agent tooling exists in the current runtime. If it does
not (for example, a plain chat surface with no Agent tool), run the stages sequentially
and proceed to step 3.

If subagent tooling is available and stage N and stage M don't depend on each other,
spawn them concurrently. Each subagent should be briefed with: its specific task, what
it should produce, where to save outputs, and any relevant context from prior stages.

Good delegation: "research X while I do Y", "process these 3 files", "verify this
independently". Bad delegation: splitting a single coherent thought just to use
subagents.

**3. Verify with a check that can fail**
Each stage must define a pass condition that an external artifact satisfies. Acceptable
checks:
- a test that runs and passes
- a file or output that provably exists in the expected shape
- a source actually fetched and read, not assumed
- an output diffed against the stated spec

"I reviewed it and it looks right" is not a check. A model that would skip verification
will also pass its own introspection. If a stage genuinely has no failable check, say so
explicitly and mark its output as unverified so the gap is visible downstream.

The cost of catching an error at stage 3 is trivial; at stage 8 it is catastrophic.

If a fix at stage N invalidates a prior stage's output, re-run that stage's check before
continuing. The loop goes forward and backward.

**4. Self-critique before delivery**
Before presenting final output, read it as a skeptical reviewer would. Name at least one
weakness or limitation. Either fix it or flag it to the user. Step 3 is the check that
can fail. Step 4 is the judgment call about what remains weak after the check passes.

## Domain-specific patterns

Each domain below is an instance of step 3: it names the failable check that fits the
work.

### Software engineering
- Read the entire relevant codebase section before writing a line
- Write tests before (or alongside) implementation, not after
- For large changes: plan the diff, then execute it
- Failable check: tests run; error paths exercised, not just the happy path

### Research / knowledge work
- Gather sources before synthesizing. Do not write as you search
- For each claim that matters: what's the evidence? what would falsify it?
- Distinguish confirmed facts from inferences; flag the latter explicitly
- Failable check: every load-bearing claim traces to a source actually read

### Data analysis
- Understand the data shape before writing any analysis
- State your hypothesis before computing, not after seeing the numbers
- Check for obvious data quality issues (nulls, duplicates, outliers) first
- Failable check: data quality assertions run against the actual data and pass

### Long-running / multi-session tasks
- Maintain a work log: decisions made, why, what was tried and failed
- At the start of any continuation, re-read the work log before doing anything
- Define done criteria upfront so you know when to stop
- Failable check: done criteria are written and testable, not vibes

## What this skill doesn't do

It doesn't make the underlying model smarter. Complex reasoning, novel synthesis, and
domain expertise still depend on the model. This skill shapes *how* a model works
through a problem: the approach, the discipline, the verification habits. It does not
change raw capability.

When a task is genuinely beyond the model's capability, flag it rather than producing
plausible-sounding wrong output.
